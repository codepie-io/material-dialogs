# Material Design Dialog
Dialogs inform users about a specific task and may contain critical information, 
require decisions, or involve multiple tasks.

## Alerts
Alerts are urgent interruptions that inform about a situation and require acknowledgement.

## Confirmation dialogs
Confirmation dialogs require users to explicitly confirm a choice.

## Full-screen dialogs (Mobile only)
Full-screen dialogs are best suited to complex tasks, or require an input method editor,
 as they group a series of tasks together before they can be saved.
